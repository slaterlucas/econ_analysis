# Analyzing Correlation Between Degredation in Environmental Factors and GDP Per Capita

Python-based project that performs an economic analysis by examining the impact of various environmental factors on GDP per capita across a diverse set of countries. Leveraging data from the World Bank, the project employs machine learning techniques, specifically a Random Forest Regressor, to determine the significance of environmental indicators such as COâ‚‚ emissions, forest area, and access to clean water on economic prosperity.

Data Retrieval: Fetches comprehensive economic and environmental data for selected countries over a 20-year period (2000-2019) using the World Bank API.
Data Processing: Cleans and merges multiple datasets to create a unified analysis-ready dataset.
Machine Learning Analysis: Utilizes Random Forest Regression to predict GDP per capita based on environmental factors.
Feature Importance Visualization: Generates insightful visualizations highlighting the importance of each environmental factor in predicting economic prosperity.

All data is sourced from the World Bank Open Data platform.
